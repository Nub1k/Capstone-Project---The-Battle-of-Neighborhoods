# Project
This is my Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods for Coursera.org

# Problem and Motivation
I want to analyse the various venues in Canary Wharf, London and see if there is a potential for opening a new restaurant. 
The audience that has the potential to be interested in this problem may be people who want to open a restaurant business in Canary Wharf.

# Data Sources
I plan to use the Foursquare API service (https://developer.foursquare.com/), 
specifically: data on categories, venues, locations; as well as ratings and likes.<br>
I will use 2 methods from this service:<br> 1) Get Details (https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/venues/details)<br>
2) Venues search (https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/venues/search)
